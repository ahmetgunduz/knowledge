= CMake

Files aren’t targets, and unless something is a target then it doesn’t get propagated around like you would expect.

add_custom_command:

- The command is only run if any target (*to-do* that apparently includes those add_executable add_library) depends on any of its output. Note that this _excludes_ other commands depending on one of those output files.

- The files listed in as outputs are only known as outputs within the CMakeLists.txt containing the add_custom_command.
