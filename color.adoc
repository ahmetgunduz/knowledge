- How do I choose bitdepth, color space of (graphic card) output? The color
  space has to match what I configure at the monitor (in OSD's preset modes),
  right?

- Also, adobe rbg defines whitepoint, brightness. So I shoudn't be able to
  change temperature, brighntess, controst via OSD on my monitor?

- Why can I modify brightness/contrast on monitor when I already selected an
  color space? Doesn't the color space _exactly_ define ligthness/a/b (or
  likewise, RGB, whereas rgb are exactly defined primaries)?

- Why can I select a color space on the monitor? doesn't the source of the
  signal tell exactly what color space the transmitted information is in?

- How to tell darktable/digikam to restrict colors to srgb? Because while
  editing I don't want to see colors that are not available in the stored jpeg
  file.

- The result of characterization is an ICC (international color consortium)
  profile; that is, an ICC profile characterizes an input or output device.
  An ICC profile maps from device to the common profile connection space
  (PCS), which is either CIELAB (L*a*b*) or CIEXYZ. CIE is the International
  Commission on Illumination. ICC profiles typically have file extenstion .icc
  or .icm.

- pmjdebruijn:
 * These days gamma 2.2 is universally accepted as a standard for displays.
 * For most purposes, a white point of 6500K (this is at least true for both
   sRGB and AdobeRGB) is good as a standard neutral white.
 * If your work is color critical, itâ€™s common to calibrate your display to
   120cd/m2.

- why should I change working color space? That's purely internal to the
  application, no? The display's color space is whatever it is (that is,
  whatever the configured icc profile says)
