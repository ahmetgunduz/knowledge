= character encoding

Character encoding pairs each character of an alphabet with something else, here
a specific byte(sequence).

ASCII:: 1 Byte per character, not using the MSB.
ISO 8859:: 1 Byte per character.
UTF-8:: asffads
UNICODE:: 
Universal Character Set (UCS):: Maps characters to integer numbers called code
points. The xxx maps byte sequences to those code points.
ANSI:: A misnomer meaning the Windows-1252 character encoding. Superset of ISO
8859-1; differs by using displayable characters in the 0x80 to 0x9F range.
Despite the (wrong) name, it never has been an ANSI standart.

The unix command +file+ dedects wheter it's ascii, UTF-8, iso-8859-x.

I think however the algorithm used mistakes certain iso-8859 as UTF-8, since
UTF-8 is tested first. See e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1. The
following bytes are valid utf-8, thus an iso-8859 char from the lines 8-B
followed by one from lines C-D are character sequences that would be
misinterpreted as UTF-8. 

Byte1: 10xx xxxx    0-3 -> 8-B
Byte2: 110x xxxx    4-5 -> C-D

There are even more, taking longer than 2byte UTF-8 sequences into account.

1 The 'basic source character set' consists of 96 characters: ...

3 The 'basic execution character set' ... shall ... contain all the members of
the basic source character set plus [some control characters], plus a 'null
character' ....  The 'execution character set' ... [is] implementation-defined
superset of the basic execution character set.  The values of the members of
the execution character sets ... are locale-specific.  [The whole paragraph
like-wise for the '(basic) execution wide-character set'].

N4140\[lex.phases]

- Phase 1: Map 'physical source file characters' ['(physical) source (file)
  character set'?] to the basic source character set.  Any source file
  character not in the basic source character set is replaced by the
  universal-character-name that designates that character.
- Phase 5: Each source character set member in a character literal or a string
  literal, as well as each escape sequence and universal-character-name in a
  character literal or a non-raw string literal, is converted to the
  corresponding member of the execution character set.
