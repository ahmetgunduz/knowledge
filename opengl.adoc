= OpenGL

Uses a client/server model.  The application is the client, with the CPU/RAM
being its ressources, and the graphics hardware is the server, with the
GPU/graphics-RAM being its ressources.  For the most part, each API function
either sets a global state variable, or is an opeartion using global state
variables.  OpenGL is window-system independent and has no support for creating
and managing windows or handling events.  Such features are provided by
3rd-party libraries such as GLUT (OpenGL Utility Library).

Shaders are programmed in GLSL (GL Shader Language), which is part of OpenGL. Is
compiled at run time.
