public key:: Encrypt plaintext or verify digital signature.
private key:: Decrypt ciphertext or create digital signature.

determined from its corresponding public key.

* So local machine can connect to host without having to enter password each
   time: ++scp id_rsa.pub _user_@_host_:.ssh/authorized_key++
