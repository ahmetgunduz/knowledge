System::Exception also has a StackTrace property

== DLLs

MyDll.def vs \_\_declspec(dllexport): [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/determining-which-exporting-method-to-use?view=vs-2017, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/exporting-from-a-dll-using-def-files?view=vs-2017]

BormScript external function: recal that the signature of a function is not
stored in a DLL. Thus these declarations need to state the signature.

tool: dependency walker

== A gtest executable which can act as mfcext test

- stdout(/stdin) doesn't seem to work in an MFC program: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5094502/how-do-i-write-to-stdout-from-an-mfc-program. We need that for gtest's output
  * Create a console using AllocConsole. But that opens a console window - I want to be able to run it as any other unittest with the output in visual studios output window -- It's probably ok, the other unit tests also open a console window
  * Anyway, this seems not to be enough to be able to use std:cout. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15543571/allocconsole-not-displaying-cout. But also that I couldn't get to work.
  
- A "MFC console mode application" seems to be possible, but not very usefuel, e.g. because messame pump is not running. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13989262/mfc-console-mode-application
